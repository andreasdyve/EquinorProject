This repository contains the data analysis and modelling part of a group project in the master's course TEK5380 at the University of Oslo. The project was about analysing operational data from a hybdrid battery vessel, and the data was provided by Equinor, who served as customer in the project.

- The data analysis is found in the various notebooks in the python notebooks folder and the finished report is the OMB6 Student Project Hybrid Marine Vessel.pdf file.
